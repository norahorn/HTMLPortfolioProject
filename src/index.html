	<h3> A bit about me </h3>
	<p> I’m a UX researcher and designer, holding a Master of Science degree from Copenhagen Business School. I have a great passion for ideas and projects in the rich interplay of technological trends, services and innovations. </p>

	<p>Diving into new fields is something that I love, which means I can take on projects out of my comfort zone. Most recently, I was involved in a field trip to Mumbai, where I helped a start-up to test and iterate their prototype and to gain a better understanding of their target group.</p>

	<p>In my free time, I like challenging my fear of heights by climbing and bouldering and exploring the live music scene in Copenhagen. I volunteer at the cultural center Huset KBH.</p>

	<h3> Here's what I can do </h3>
	<p> I have a throrough understanding of user-centered design and research methods. Ich beherrsche prototyping tools wie Axure, Adobe XD und Balsamiq. I am comfortable to do both, low-fi and high-fi prototypes. I love going on paper! </p>

	<p>At the moment, I am teaching myself how to code. I am taking classes and assignments on codeschool.com for HTML CSS and Javascript. Learning from scratch!</p>
